# Blogger Alternative

This project is started to develop a web application with a better blog editing experience than the current Google Blogger web application. It will involve more keyboard shortcuts, and possibly integrate Markdown support. 

# Current features:
- An editor that has a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) mode and a Markdown editor mode
- Markdown support 
- Ability to add screenshots to blog posts

# Technology Stack: 
* MERN: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
* Frontend libraries: ReactStrap, Toast UI Text Editor
* Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Setting up
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/C-likethis123/Blogger-Alternative.git` to get a working copy in your computer
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `npm run start` to start the development server
4. Run `npm run server` to start the database (will phase out as soon as I integrate the Google Blogger API)
